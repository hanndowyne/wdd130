            I am a Software Development student at BYU Idaho, building a strong foundation in programming, problem-solving, and real-world application development. Through hands-on projects and courses in languages like Python, JavaScript, and web development frameworks, I am learning how to create software that is both functional and user-friendly. I’m passionate about technology, excited to grow in this field, and committed to using my skills to solve meaningful problems and contribute to the future of innovation.
